# **FolkSongs Music Generation**
- This Project is a part of [**MIT Deep Learning 6.S191**](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) training workshop. I personally find this Project very interesting and insightful in the evergoing field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In this Project, I have used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to build the Model which generates the Folk songs music itself.

**Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)**
- A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

**Snapshot of Loss Function**
- As we can see that the Loss function is gradually decreasing which means the Model is not over-fitting.
